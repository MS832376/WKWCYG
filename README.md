 Who Knows What Cards You'll Get

A Card game that functions similarly to the card game "War" but with a slightly faster pace.
Allows for more than 2 players, and has additional rules in place for War scenarios.

Initial Draw: All players place 3 cards face down, and a fourth card face up. If there are no ties, person with the highest card value takes the pot.

Lower War: At least two players who did not win the initial draw, but placed cards with the same value, have to participate in a war. Winner of that must participate in a war with the winner of the initial draw. Winner of that war gets all cards in the pot.

Upper War: Similar to normal war, where at least two players play cards with the highest value. Winner of the war gets all cards in pot.

A "War" in this context means at least two players placed down a card with the same value, and need to repeat the initial draw process. This creates a large pot and the winner takes all.

Uses multiple decks (users/2 and then round up to nearest whole number)
