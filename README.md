 Who Knows What Cards You'll Get

A Card game that functions similarly to the card game "War"
Allows for more than 2 players, and has additional rules in place for War scenarios.
Lower War: At least two players who did not win the initial draw, but placed cards with the same value, have to participate in a war. Winner of that must participate in a war with the winner of the initial draw. Winner of that war gets all cards in the pot.
Upper War: Similar to normal war, where at least two players play cards with the highest value. Winner of the war gets all cards in pot.

Uses multiple decks (users/2 and then round up to nearest whole number)
